    and baptize them.  In order to disciple someone though, they need to be a
    believer.  The best way to get new believers is through initiative evangelism. 
    So in order to obey Christ's last command to us, we must share the gospel so we
    have people to disciple."

  additionalMoralComments: "Ever since I was young, my parents taught me to treat women with respect.  I
    never struggled with pornography because I thought it would be putting images
    into my head and maybe ruin this sacred marriage thing called sex.  I am still a
    virgin and proud of it, and I want to keep it that way until I get married."

  personalTestimonyGrowth: "When I was 6 years old, my father shared with me about Jesus and how he died for
    my sins.  This was the specific time I accepted Christ into my life.  But as
    most young kids I didn't really know what I had done and there was no spiritual
    growth.  My sophomore year in high school is when I finally understood what
    being a believer was.  And at that time I rededicated my life to Christ.  Since
    then my growth has been steady.  Over the years I have developed my relationship
    with Christ.  But it was not until college that the relationship became very
    personal and strong.  Through being discipled, and 2 summer projects, I learned
    that there is more than just a surface relationship with Christ, and now my
    relationship is meaningful and deep."

  alcoholUseDecision: "As someone over the age of 21, I know I have a right to drink.  But there are
    certain situations in which I think drinking is inappropriate.  I do not drink
    with anyone under the age of 21.  Because in that situation I believe I would be
    causing someone to stumble.  Most of the time, I will only drink with people who
    I know do not have a problem with alcohol and we have previously talked about
    our views."

    and holding hands.  I believe anything past that would be a huge opening to that
    temptation of sex.  I like to treat my girlfriends with respect, because if God
    hasn?t chosen them to be my wife then they will be someone?s some day, and I
    don?t want to ruin the sacred act of sex for them."

  participationExplanation: I would feel comfortable being either a leader or a team participant.  God has blessed me with some wonderful spiritual gifts.  One is leadership.  I feel like I am a born leader and can handle the challenge of leading a team.  So I would feel comfortable as a leader.  I also know that we will be part of a team.  And as a team member I would be able to give my insight on what direction we should go.  So I would also feel comfortable fitting the role of a team member.

  explanationOfSalvation: "Jesus says in John 14:6, \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes
    to the Father except through me.\" This verse pretty much sums up how someone
    can obtain salvation.  The only way anyone can obtain salvation is by believing
    with their heart that Christ came down, lived a perfect life, and died for your
    sins.  Knowing is not enough, you must believe that Christ is your savior and
    you will be saved."

    friends who are of age and know my view on drinking.  I try to avoid drinking at
    parties because people tend to associate drunkeness with party drinkers."

  hasSexualGuidelines: "1"
  sexualInvolvementExplanation: "The Bible says that sex is for marriage.  With that said I believe that one
    should stay as far away from temptation as possible.  In any relationship I
    believe that both parties should keep their clothes on.  You should avoid
    touching in ways to arouse the other partner.  So I believe that petting, oral
    sex, and sexual intercourse are wrong outside the context of marriage."

  differenceIndwellingFilled: "I think that being indwelt by the Holy Spirit is what happens immediately after
    you accept Christ.  God sends the Holy Spirit down.  Being filled with the Holy
    Spirit means a Spirit-filled life from the question above.  Once the Holy Spirit
    is in you heart, your actions depend on whether or not you will be filled with
    the Holy Spirit.  You can have the Holy Spirit in your life and still not be
    filled."
  internshipObjectives: My goals for my intern year would be to spread the gospel to the students at whatever university I work with.  On top of that I believe it is crucial to disciple students and aid them in their spiritual growth.  By doing this they will be equipped to share the gospel to their own people.  I want many Russians to come to the Lord and be energized to reach the world for Christ.

  tobaccoUseExplanation: "In college there has been a fad of smoking cigars or pipes.  I occasionally
    smoke a pipe or a cigar.  My view on this is the same as drinking.  It can be a
    stumbling block for someone so I am very selective when I do participate, and
    most of the time it is during male bonding events.  The last time I smoked was
    at least over a month and a half.  This summer when I was in Moscow our team
    leader made the rule of no tobacco use.  I had no problem refraining from using
    these products."

    in my Bible in order to fully grasp what God is trying to say in the passage.  I
