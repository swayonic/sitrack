  personalTestimonyGrowth: "When I was 6 years old, my father shared with me about Jesus and how he died for
    my sins.  This was the specific time I accepted Christ into my life.  But as
    most young kids I didn't really know what I had done and there was no spiritual
    growth.  My sophomore year in high school is when I finally understood what
    being a believer was.  And at that time I rededicated my life to Christ.  Since
    then my growth has been steady.  Over the years I have developed my relationship
    with Christ.  But it was not until college that the relationship became very
    personal and strong.  Through being discipled, and 2 summer projects, I learned
    that there is more than just a surface relationship with Christ, and now my
    relationship is meaningful and deep."

    can obtain salvation.  The only way anyone can obtain salvation is by believing

    Spirit means a Spirit-filled life from the question above.  Once the Holy Spirit
    is in you heart, your actions depend on whether or not you will be filled with
    the Holy Spirit.  You can have the Holy Spirit in your life and still not be

I want many Russians to come to the Lord and be energized to reach the world for Christ.

    should save themselves, not only physically, but emotionally and spiritually for
    one another, just as Jesus waits for His bride.  I believe that if a couple are
    seriously dating they should be heading towards marriage.  The union between a
    man & woman should not occur until marriage.  As a recently married man I waited
    29 years before I had sexual intercourse,  my wife waited 25 years.  This has
    been one of the greatest gifts of our marriage, knowing that we waited for each
    other before we even knew each other.  As a married man I consider spending any

    response to His Word, reading His Word and just listening to Him, or finding
    verses topically about an issue I desire His guidance upon."

    spiritually.  The role of a discipleship leader enabled me to serve the members
    of the group both in and outside the group.  I enjoyed facilitating the
    discussions, planning the materials for discussion, depending on the Lord for
    His leadership in aiding those in the group to grow, and helping to impart a
    vision for the lost and the world.  The leadership roles I have had, were given
    to me, because of being a servant 1st."
