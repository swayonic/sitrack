CasAuth
=======

CAS is a very good authentication system for bigger companies. This plugin
adds simple CAS authentication to a Rails application. By default
only 3 configuration options need to be set, and then everything will
work (provided you've got the necessary CAS infrastructure, that is).

For more usage information, see the RDoc for CAS::Filter.
